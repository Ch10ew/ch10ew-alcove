As I grow older, I realise more and more that it is hard to keep my passion going. Keeping that flame alive takes so much more that it used to, and it hit me. I've been living without slowing down. I've been piling up more and more obligations, responsibilities. I've not taken the time to look back at my decisions.

As the environment around me changes, I also change. Humans are everchanging, malleable in nature and by nature. Trying to hold on to dear life to my passion, blindly believing that this is still the true path I want, but is it really my true calling? Do I really have the resolve to abandon other aspects of life to pursue my passion? Is what I'm doing contributing towards achieving my goals? Am I being swept away by the flows of life?

I've always had the heart of a creator, delving into various arts, and sciences. My projects end as fast as they start, most of them not seeing the light of day. However, I've always held game development on a pedestal, as _**the**_ one fire that burn the brightest in my heart. Recently, though, it has not been the case. I feel myself putting other hobbies above game development. Humans are everchanging, malleable in nature and by nature.

_To those who still have a flame in them. I wish that flame never dies._

On another note, I have some qualms about social media. We are beyond the time where posting is truly about passion, where expressing ourselves online was free, where we could feel a sense of community. Trying to post anything now that doesn't hit the standard of society will just be hit with "cringe". Also, the numbers, the numbers take a toll on me. This is one of the reasons why I started my website. I want a space, for myself. My target audience is future me.

_Let's see how this will age..._
